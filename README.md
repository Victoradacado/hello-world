# hello-world

Hi man, this is victor. this is the first time that I logged into Github account. 
I like the concept of version management and how team work together to focus on problem solving. 
Currently, I am working on unifying the standard practice to manage Tuki/Looker version with Elisa. (our developer)

Cheers, I hope this will be helpful to you.
Victor
